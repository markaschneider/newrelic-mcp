- 🔍 **Entity Search** - Discover and inspect entities across your infrastructure
- 📈 **Synthetics Monitoring** - Manage synthetic monitors and checks
- 🔧 **NerdGraph API** - Direct access to New Relic's GraphQL API
- 🌐 **REST v2 Tools (2.0+)** - High‑value REST endpoints for deployments, APM apps, metrics, and alerts

## Installation

### Quick Install with Smithery

To install or deploy via Smithery, see the official docs: [Deployments](https://smithery.ai/docs/build/deployments), [Project Configuration](https://smithery.ai/docs/build/project-config), and [`smithery.yaml` Reference](https://smithery.ai/docs/build/project-config/smithery-yaml).

To install New Relic MCP for Claude Desktop automatically via [Smithery](https://smithery.ai/mcp/newrelic-mcp):

```bash
npx @smithery/cli install newrelic-mcp --client claude
```

### Smithery CLI (recommended)

We recommend the Smithery CLI for local development, inspection, and deployment flows. Benefits:

- Unified dev/build/deploy workflow, client‑agnostic
- Dev server with hot‑reload and playground (optional tunnel)
- Build bundles for `stdio` or `shttp` transports
- Inspect a server interactively; run with supplied config
- Simple install per client

Examples:

```bash
# Hot‑reload dev server
npx @smithery/cli dev src/server.ts --port 8181 --no-open

# Build production bundle (shttp transport)
npx @smithery/cli build src/server.ts --out .smithery/index.cjs --transport shttp

# Inspect a published server
npx @smithery/cli inspect @cloudbring/newrelic-mcp

# Run with config (env via JSON)
npx @smithery/cli run @cloudbring/newrelic-mcp --config '{"NEW_RELIC_API_KEY":"...","NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID":"...","NEW_RELIC_REGION":"US"}'

# Install into a specific client
npx @smithery/cli install newrelic-mcp --client claude

# Open playground
npx @smithery/cli playground --port 3001
```

Notes:

- This repo includes a minimal `smithery.yaml` with `runtime: "typescript"` to align with TypeScript‑first deployments.
- See the CLI reference for all commands and flags: [smithery-ai/cli](https://github.com/smithery-ai/cli).

## Troubleshooting

<details>
<summary>Connection Issues</summary>

If you're having trouble connecting:

1. Verify your API key is valid:

   For US region:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST https://api.newrelic.com/graphql \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     -H 'API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY' \
     -d '{"query":"{ actor { user { email } } }"}'
   ```

   For EU region:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST https://api.eu.newrelic.com/graphql \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     -H 'API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY' \
     -d '{"query":"{ actor { user { email } } }"}'
   ```

2. Check that your Account ID is correct
3. Ensure your API key has the necessary permissions
4. Check the MCP client logs for detailed error messages

</details>

<details>
<summary>Permission Errors</summary>

If you receive permission errors:

1. Verify your API key has the required permissions:
   - For NRQL queries: `NRQL query` permission
   - For APM data: `APM` read permissions
   - For alerts: `Alerts` read/write permissions

2. Create a new API key with broader permissions if needed

- **Server Layer**: Manages MCP protocol and tool routing

Each tool:

- Has a single, focused purpose
- Validates inputs using Zod schemas
- Returns structured, typed responses
- Includes comprehensive error handling

| Project | Status | Transport(s) | Deployments | APM Apps | Metrics | Alerts | Synthetics | Notes |
|---------|--------|---------------|-------------|----------|---------|--------|-----------|-------|
| This project (newrelic-mcp) | Active | NerdGraph + REST v2 | Create/List/Delete | List (NerdGraph + REST) | Host names + timeslices (REST) | Policies + Incidents (NG + REST) | List/Create (browser) | Comprehensive tests and docs |

Planned enhancements (based on REST v2 catalog and user demand):
- Alerts: violations and conditions management via REST where available
- Metrics: broader app‑level metrics endpoints (names/data) beyond per‑host
- Additional REST coverage: labels, key transactions, mobile apps (prioritized by feedback)
